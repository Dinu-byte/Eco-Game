  - I'm so sorry it had to come like this, it's the adults' fault if the city is
    being infested with living trash.
  - We didn't think it would've become a problem for the future generations, but
    here we are, it happened.
  - I wish that this problem would end, but for this wish to come true, we must FIGHT!
    We have to do our best to resolve the problem...
  - But we'll also have to make sure it never happens again, so please always be
    carefull and do the right thing, kid.
