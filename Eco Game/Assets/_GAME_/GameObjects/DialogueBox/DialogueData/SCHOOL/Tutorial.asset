  - Oh no! the trash all over the city has come to life, we have to do something
    about it! Please, help the citizens defeat all the trash and make a better world
    for all living beings!
  - Anyways, I'm going to help you start off the journey.
  - Move with WASD, perform a basic attack with LEFT CLICK, throw a ranged attack
    with RIGHT CLICK, heal with SPACE (it has a cooldown) and interact with people
    by pressing E.
  - Oh, and don't forget the most important thing, if you press F you can access
    the stats menu, where you can upgrade your statistics and become even stronger!
  - Hope this helps, bye now!
